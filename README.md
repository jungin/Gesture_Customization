# Gesture_Customization

This repository contains my research code for a gesture customization project.
I convert Jester video frames to skeletons using MediaPipe, and train TCN / ST-GCN
models with a Prototypical Network–style few-shot learning setup.

Note: this is a research prototype repo, not a polished library.
